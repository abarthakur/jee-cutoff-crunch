# jee-cutoff-crunch (archive)

Crunch some numbers for the JEE cutoffs (downloaded from the jeeadv.ac.in). 

* 201X.html file corresponds to https://josaa.nic.in/Result/Result/OpeningClosingRankArchieveN.aspx?Year=201X
* This is parsed to 201X.json by read.py using bs4.
* crunch.py basically just sorts and filters the list, and outputs matches.
